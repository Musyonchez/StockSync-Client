# StockSync Client

The client-side implementation for StockSync, a project that synchronizes stock information across multiple stores. This repository contains the front-end code responsible for user interfaces, interactions, and communication with the server.

## Features
- **User Interface:** Intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing stock information.
- **Real-time Updates:** Utilizes real-time communication with the server for instant stock updates.
- **Store Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with different stores to provide a unified stock management experience.

## Technologies Used
- React for building interactive user interfaces.
- GraphQL for efficient communication with the server.
- Next.js for server-side rendering and optimized performance.
- [Add any other relevant technologies]

## Getting Started
To run the StockSync Client locally:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/StockSync-Client.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
